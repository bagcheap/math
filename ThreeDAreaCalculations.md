To find the area of 3D objects using integration, you'll typically be working with surface integrals. The exact approach depends on the type of 3D object and whether you're dealing with surface area or volume. Here's a quick overview of the process:

1. **Surface Area of a 3D Object**:

   - For a parametric surface defined by \(\vec{r}(u, v)\), where \(u\) and \(v\) are parameters, the surface area \(A\) is given by:
     \[
     A = \iint_S \|\vec{r}\_u \times \vec{r}\_v\| \, dA
     \]
     Here, \(\vec{r}\_u\) and \(\vec{r}\_v\) are partial derivatives of the surface position vector with respect to \(u\) and \(v\), and \(\times\) denotes the cross product.

   - For surfaces described by a function \(z = f(x, y)\) over a region \(D\) in the \(xy\)-plane, you can calculate the surface area using:
     \[
     A = \iint_D \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)^2} \, dA
     \]
     This method works well for surfaces like portions of spheres, cylinders, or more complex shapes defined by functions.

2. **Volume of 3D Objects**:
   - To find the volume, you can use a triple integral:
     \[
     V = \iiint_V dV
     \]
     For certain objects, such as solids of revolution, you can simplify this with cylindrical or spherical coordinates.

Would you like to start with a specific shape or need help setting up integrals for a particular type of object?

To calculate the surface area of a toroid, we can set up a surface integral using the parametric definition of the toroid.

### 1. Parametrize the Toroid

A toroid can be thought of as a circle of radius \( r \) (the radius of the tube) rotating around an axis in a larger circle of radius \( R \) (the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube). The parametric equation for a toroid is:

\[
\vec{r}(u, v) = \begin{pmatrix} (R + r \cos v) \cos u \\ (R + r \cos v) \sin u \\ r \sin v \end{pmatrix}
\]
where:

- \( u \) varies from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \),
- \( v \) varies from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \).

### 2. Calculate the Partial Derivatives

The partial derivatives with respect to \( u \) and \( v \) are:

1. \(\vec{r}\_u = \frac{\partial \vec{r}}{\partial u} = \begin{pmatrix} - (R + r \cos v) \sin u \\ (R + r \cos v) \cos u \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\)
2. \(\vec{r}\_v = \frac{\partial \vec{r}}{\partial v} = \begin{pmatrix} - r \sin v \cos u \\ - r \sin v \sin u \\ r \cos v \end{pmatrix}\)

### 3. Calculate the Cross Product \(\vec{r}\_u \times \vec{r}\_v\)

The cross product \(\vec{r}\_u \times \vec{r}\_v\) gives a vector normal to the surface, and its magnitude provides the "area element" for the surface.

\[
\|\vec{r}\_u \times \vec{r}\_v\| = r (R + r \cos v)
\]

### 4. Set Up and Evaluate the Surface Integral

The surface area \(A\) of the toroid is the integral of \(\|\vec{r}\_u \times \vec{r}\_v\|\) over \( u \) and \( v \):

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} r (R + r \cos v) \, du \, dv
\]

Breaking this down:

1. Integrate with respect to \( u \):
   \[
   \int_0^{2\pi} \, du = 2\pi
   \]
2. Then integrate with respect to \( v \):
   \[
   A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} r (R + r \cos v) \, du \, dv = 2\pi \int_0^{2\pi} r (R + r \cos v) \, dv
   \]
3. Solving the inner integral with respect to \( v \):
   \[
   A = 2\pi \cdot 2\pi R r = 4\pi^2 R r
   \]

### Final Result

The surface area of a toroid with major radius \( R \) and minor radius \( r \) is:

\[
A = 4 \pi^2 R r
\]

This formula shows how the surface area scales with both the size of the central circle (radius \( R \)) and the radius of the tube (radius \( r \)).
